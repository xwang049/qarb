# qarb
A Framework for Data-Driven Mathematical Modeling &amp; Scalable Computation, based on Quantitative portfolio management : the art and science of statistical arbitrage
🚀 Key Features:

Quant-First Design: Native support for stochastic calculus, time series analysis, and Monte Carlo methods.

Zero-Cost Abstraction: Unified API for high-performance numerical backends (NumPy/PyTorch/JAX/CuPy).

Precision Control: Seamless switching between FP32/64 and symbolic arithmetic (e.g., financial derivatives pricing).

Hybrid Execution: Auto-parallelization across CPUs/GPUs with topology-aware task scheduling.

🔧 Core Modules:

Quantitative Optimization (Portfolio Allocation, CVaR Minimization)

Statistical Engine (Hypothesis Testing, Bayesian Inference)

Risk Modeling (VaR/ES Calculation, Stress Testing)

Market Data Toolkit (OHLCV Pipeline, Tick Data Compression)

🌐 Why QARB?

"QARB bridges the gap between academic quant research and production trading systems—whether backtesting complex strategies or optimizing hedge ratios, it delivers math-integrity without sacrificing speed."
